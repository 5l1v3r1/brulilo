# NOTE #

This is very much an alpha release, and all functionality is not yet
implemented/working.  Right now, the code does little more than parse
an input file into a collection of objects that represent the network.
Documentation and actual implementation forthcoming...

## brulilo ##

A toy code to test out solving thermonuclear reaction networks with
various integration schemes. brulilo is released as open-source under
the LANL copyright (see LICENSE file for copyright) as LA-CC-15-029.

*What is 'brulilo'??*

In hydro codes, a reaction networks is often referred to as a
'burner.'  For lack of more creativity, I went to Google Translate,
typed in 'burner' and selected the next language below English:
Esperanto.  The result was brulilo.
