# brulilo #

A toy code to test out solving thermonuclear reaction networks with
various integration schemes.

*What is 'brulilo'??*

In hydro codes, a reaction networks is often referred to as a
'burner.'  For lack of more creativity, I went to Google Translate,
typed in 'burner' and selected the next language below English:
Esperanto.  The result was brulilo.
